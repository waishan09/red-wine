## About 
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) and our team aims to develop a model that can predict wine quality based on its physiochemical properties. We will be utilising the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

## Problem statement
How do different variables affect the red dry winesâ€™ quality? Are we able to predict the red dry wine quality based on its physiochemical properties? Which model would be best used in predicting the red dry wines' quality?
## Models used
  1. Logistic Regression  
  2. Random Forest
  3. Decision Tree
## Conclusion
Better quality wine tend to  
- contain higher contents of alcohol,sulphates and fixed acidity  
- contain lower contents of volatile acidity and total sulfur dioxide 

## What did we learn from this project
  1. Random forest
  2. GridSearchCV
  3. Concepts about F1 score
